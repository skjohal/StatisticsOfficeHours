# Statistics "Office Hours"
Hello! Thank you for signing up to participate in our statistics "office hours" for undergraduate students completing research in UC Davis' Psychology Department. We have included a HTML file called "Office Hours_Statistical Tests" that contains code and explanation for conducting and interpreting common statistical tests. 

This document was created by Simran K. Johal and Danielle Siegel for this "office hours" - please do not distribute outside of this workshop!
